# unmask

Unmask was created by Paul Adams and Simone Rebaudengo in shanghai. 
The original idea was inspired by sharing emotions while 
wearing a mask, the first design was based on littleHeart bits 
by Mika Lin and Edward Jiang from Xinchejian

# Board Design
The latest Design has yet to be tested, its redesigned from the bottom up.
While still using an AVR microcontroller but this time using a ATTINY85 instead of a mega8 which the Littleheart bits was based on.


# Code
Unfortunatly we have not yet written code for the latest hardware, but the original code is published here as a placeholder.


# next steps

Build out one fully functional mask
